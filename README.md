This is a simple app I made in my Python studies, feel free to check it out by downloading the executable file and running it on your device. 
Write down your activity("to-do") and press Add to add it to the list, click on a to-do to select it, you can then write something using the input box and press Edit to make changes to it, or press Complete to delete the to-do.
